Conflict and Conservation: Evaluating Land Cover Dynamics in the Tri-Border Region of Rwanda, Uganda, and the DR Congo

ABSTRACT

The environmental impact of armed conflict is often an under-considered but important aspect of post-conflict recovery. The variety and complexity of these impacts can be extensive, typically varying with the conflictâ€™s intensity, scale, and duration. Land cover is often used as a proxy to explore environmental change, but diverse and insecure environments are generally not captured sufficiently on global land cover maps, necessitating development of site-specific maps. This research investigated the impact of different types of conflict around four protected areas in a tri-border area between Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Land cover maps were developed using Random Forest in Google Earth Engine for four time periods from 1987 to 2024 to measure change over time. Findings indicate that areas near conflict zones in Rwanda and the DRC underwent more significant land cover changes compared to Uganda, which experienced greater changes farther away from conflict. Notably, the DRC displayed the most dynamic range of land cover shifts across all time spans, possibly mirroring its similarly wide variation in conflict type and length. The national parks exhibited minimal land cover change during and after conflict. This resilience is likely attributed to substantial conservation investment and natural barriers imposed by challenging topography. This research underscores the nuanced relationship between armed conflict and environmental change, highlighting the need for targeted environmental strategies in post-conflict settings.

REPOSITORY

The scripts contained within this repository are divided into land cover classification and visualisations. The land cover classification was done using Random Forest supervised machine learning within Google Earth Engine. Most of these are in JavaScript, with some additional scripts in Python for managing the data. Visualisation of data following classification were done using Python and R Studio as well as ArcGIS Pro (not included here).
